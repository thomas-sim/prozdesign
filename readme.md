# Microprocessor design with VHDL

School project for the "Prozessor Design" course from the Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule von Jena. The purpose of the project is to implement a set of AVR instructions in a FPGA to emulate an Atmega.

The project is made to work with Vivado WebDesign Suite and the xc7a35tcpg236-1 FPGA (xilinx 7)

Coded with love with emacs.
